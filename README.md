# LLLHotReloadPatch

Fixes a common error (mostly with RebalancedMoons) that prevents the player from landing on first sessions or when rejoining. The code is entirely pretty much made by [xuxiaolan](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/XuXiaolan/), so huge thanks to them for this temporary workaround until the issue gets fixed directly.
